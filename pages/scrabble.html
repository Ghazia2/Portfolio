            <p class="article-para">Scrabble is a word game in which two to four players score points by placing tiles, each bearing a single letter, onto a game board divided into a 15×15 grid of squares. The tiles must form words that, in crossword fashion, read left to right in rows or downward in columns, and be included in a standard dictionary..</p>

            <p class="article-para">Unlike the traditional Scrabble game, the task was to make a single-player game where all tiles and positions on the board are of equal value.</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="article-li">Players would be assigned random 12 tiles and a 12×12 Board.</li>
                <li class="article-li">The check button will verify the word from a dictionary. If the word is valid, new tiles will be allotted to the player to complete the set of 12.</li>
                <li class="article-li">On submit button, the score will be calculated based on the valid words on the board. </li>

Learning them was fun, but the unavailability of online resources made the whole process strenuous. My previous understanding/ knowledge of Unity Engine also helped since they both have the same workflow.</p>

Not only did it boost my self-confidence, but it also tested my competence because of which I recognized the areas I have been slacking.</p>
