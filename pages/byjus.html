            <p class="article-para">XPLORE is a interactive learning vertical of the BYJUâ€™S app which makes simulations and games across K12 Math and Science. It is built to bridge the gap of hands-on learning on online platforms with a set of learning experiences. The learning experiences are structured in such way that they are as engaging as a animated video and as active as a question. The team consists of 50+ content creators, 10+ UI designers, 50+ artists, 25+ vendors, 8 producers, and 30+ developers.</p>

            <p class="article-para">I am responsible for developing the learning experiences which make XPLORE fun, interactive and engaging, i.e. games and simulations. We collaborate with the game designers, content, UI/UX, audio, and QA team to deliver the best learning experience. These experiences are built on the Cocos Creator engine using TypeScript. In the two years of working on XPLORE, I have made 50+ games and 5+ simulations.</p>
