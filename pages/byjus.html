            <p class="article-para">XPLORE is an interactive learning vertical within the BYJU’S app, designed to create simulations and games for K–12 Math and Science. It aims to bridge the gap between hands-on learning and online education by offering a series of engaging, experience-driven modules. These learning experiences are crafted to be as captivating as animated videos and as thought-provoking as interactive questions.<br><br>The XPLORE team comprises over 50 content creators, 10+ UI designers, 50+ artists, 25+ vendors, 8 producers, and 30+ developers working together to deliver high-quality educational content.</p>

            <h1 class="article-heading">My Contribution</h1>
            <p class="article-para">I was responsible for building the core learning experiences—namely the games and simulations that made XPLORE engaging, interactive, and fun. I collaborated closely with game designers, content writers, UI/UX designers, audio engineers, and QA testers to ensure each experience met the highest standards.<br><br>These projects were developed using Cocos Creator with TypeScript. Over the course of two years, I developed more than 50 games and 5 simulations, each carefully crafted to enhance conceptual understanding through play and interaction.</p>

            <h1 class="article-heading">Challenges</h1>
            <p class="article-para">When I joined the project, both TypeScript and Cocos Creator were new to me. While learning them was an exciting challenge, the lack of online learning resources made the process more demanding. However, my prior experience with the Unity Engine which shared a similar workflow helped me adapt quickly and efficiently.</p>

            <p class="article-para">Working with Byju's for two years was an incredibly enriching experience. One of the most valuable takeaways was my personal growth—not just as a developer, but as a collaborator. Interacting with professionals across different domains and learning from their problem-solving approaches and workflows helped me become a more competent, communicative, and well-rounded professional.</p>
